## 🛠 THE 4-LAYER WORKFLOW
Setiap modul akan dijalankan dengan protokol ketat ini:

0. [L0] BRIEFING:
   - LLM Ngejelasin mau bikin projek apa sebenernya (PRD).
   - Ekspektasi setelah kelar suatu modul
1. [L1] MENTAL GYM: 
   - Konsep First Principles & Big Picture.
   - Latsol Logika (Non-coding) & Syntax Primer.
2. [L2] SCALABLE SCAFFOLD: 
   - Setup folder di repo `flame-labs` (Feature-first).
   - Git Commit discipline.
3. [L3] DEEP "DOING" (Syntax Mastery):
   - READ: Pahami anatomi kode.
   - PREDICT: Tebak output sebelum run.
   - TYPE: Ketik manual baris per baris (NO COPY-PASTE).
   - BREAK: Sengaja dirusak buat paham error handling.
   - DRILL: Modifikasi fitur tanpa panduan.
4. [L4] HARDWARE DEBUGGER:
   - Trace elektron dari UI ke Register CPU/Kernel.
   - Latticework check (menghubungkan ke modul sebelumnya).
