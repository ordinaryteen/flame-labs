## SKILLSET
[MENTAL MODELS & PHILOSOPHY]
- First Principles Thinking: Always dissect problems down to the binary/physical level (No analogies).
- Hierarchy of Sciences: Understand the placement of problems at the hardware level vs. the application level.
- The "Giant" Strategy: Focus on scalability and massive impact.
- Abstraction Management: Know when to use libraries (High-level) and when to optimize manually (Low-level).

[DEEP TECH: SILICON & ATOMIC LOGIC]
- Process Node Mastery: Understand the limitations of physics and architectural fabrication (7nm Ryzen 3).
- Quantum Tunneling Awareness: Understand the phenomenon of electron leakage at transistor scales below 5nm.
- Atomic Floor Limits: Understand the physical limitations of silicon materials at 0.2nm.

[CPU ARCHITECTURE & EXECUTION]
- Clock Synchronization: Understand the role of the Crystal Oscillator and PLL in a microprocessor.
- Register Set Management: The physical separation of User Mode and Kernel Mode registers at the circuit level.
- Multi-Core Orchestration: Understand parallel thread execution on physical cores.
- Instruction Cycle: Understand the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle of binary ISA instructions (x86-64).

[HARDWARE-LEVEL RELIABILITY]
- Atomic Operations: Identify unsafe instructions at the machine level (Race Condition).
- Physical Memory Awareness: Understand the physical relationship between data in RAM and the 'volatile' keyword.
- Hardware Interrupt Flow: The IRQ mechanism acts as a physical signal to replace the CPU context.
- Thermal & Power Constraints: The relationship between workload (CPU/IO Bursts) and CPU die heat management.

[NETWORKING & INFRASTRUCTURE]
- OSI Model Mastery: Understand the functions and limitations of Layers 1 to 7.
- Packet Analysis: Anatomy of Ethernet Frames, IP Headers, and TCP Segments.
- L4 Strategy: Choosing TCP (Reliability) vs. UDP (Speed).
- Handshake Logic: 3-Way Handshake Algorithm & Sequence Number Tracking.
- L3 Routing: Routing Table, Next-Hop, & Default Gateway logic.
- IP Architecture: Binary Subnet Masking & IPv4 to IPv6 Transition.
- Infrastructure Awareness: The Role of Cable Landing Stations, Repeaters, & International Hubs (Singapore).

## 🛠 THE 4-LAYER WORKFLOW
Each module will be executed with this strict protocol:

0. [L0] BRIEFING:
- LLM Explains what the project is actually about (PRD).
- Expectations after completing a module.
1. [L1] MENTAL GYM:
- First Principles & Big Picture Concepts.
- Latsol Logic (Non-coding) & Syntax Primer.
2. [L2] SCALABLE SCAFFOLD:
- Folder Setup in the `flame-labs` repo (Feature-first).
- Git Commit Discipline.
3. [L3] DEEP "DOING" (Syntax Mastery):
- READ: Understand the anatomy of the code.
- PREDICT: Guess the output before running.
- TYPE: Type manually line by line (NO COPY-PASTE).
- BREAK: Intentionally break the code to understand error handling.
- DRILL: Modify features without guidance.
4. [L4] HARDWARE DEBUGGER:
- Trace electrons from the UI to CPU/Kernel Registers.
- Latticework check (connecting to previous modules).
